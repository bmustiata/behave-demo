= `ls` behave testing

This repository just holds the test sample that was presented for the `behave`
presentation.

In it there are two scenarios in a feature file that attempt to check if the
implementation of `ls` is correct.

== Running

[source,sh]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
pip install behave
behave
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Things to look for:

* `after_scenario` implemented in the `environment.py`
* `use_step_matcher("re")` at the top of the `steps/tests.py`
